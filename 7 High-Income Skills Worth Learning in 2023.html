            <h3 class="headline6">High-Income Skills Worth Learning in 2023</h3>
            <h5>Written by Admin | Dec 7, 2021</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg"><img src="./assets/images/blog/high-skills.avif" /></div>
            <p>Every job requires some combination of workplace skills and technical skills, and chances are, you have
                already built an impressive skill set derived from your education or past work experience. </p>
            <p>High-income skills are tools and expertise that employers tend to value highly and may make it easier to
                change jobs and even industries, according to a 2022 report from McKinsey & Company [1]. These job
                skills may be rare, and they’re often crucial to running a successful business.</p>

            <p>As you aim to advance your career or shift your career focus, you may want to find ways to highlight your
                high-income skills. Depending on your desired career path, you may be able to leverage these skills to
                reach your salary goals.</p> <br>

            <h4 class="headline6">7 high-income skills to learn</h4>
            <p>The skills listed here are all transferable across a number of career paths. As you read this list,
                consider your career goals, past experiences, and the job descriptions of your desired roles, and notice
                whether any of these skills may naturally facilitate your path.</p><br>

            <h4 class="headline7">1. Data analysis</h4>
            <p>Analytical thinking and innovation is the top skill forecasted in the World Economic Forum’s Future of
                Jobs Report. As businesses across industries increasingly rely on data to make informed decisions,
                they require more employees with the ability to collect, interpret, and share data that can solve their
                business problems.</p>

            <p>People skilled in data analysis may use a range of tools including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SQL,
                Tableau, R, or Python.</p><br>

            <h4 class="headline7">2. Software development</h4>
            <p>ncreasingly, industries are turning toward technology to advance their business capabilities, and they
                need people skilled in developing, maintaining, and improving their technological systems. People who
                work in DevOps or software engineering build, monitor, and control an organization’s technology.</p>
            <p>People skilled in DevOps or software engineering may use tools like Git, Docker, Jenkins, or Kubernetes,
                and may know coding languages like Python, Java, or C++.</p><br>

            <h4 class="headline7">3. User experience</h4>
            <p>Hand in hand with technological development comes user experience (UX), which has to do with the way a
                consumer interacts with a product. People working in UX figure out the best way to present a product to
                consumers. They may conduct research, design, or help market a product.</p>
            <p>Although they still involve some data, UX roles are grounded in design and tend to offer room for
                creativity, and they require a high level of social perceptiveness</p><br>

            <h4 class="headline7">4. Web development</h4>
            <p>Web development brings together the fundamentals of software development and user experience,
                incorporating the technical aspects of the former with the design elements of the latter. People skilled
                in web development will also be familiar with technical search engine optimization (SEO) in order to
                design and program websites that meet business needs.</p><br>

            <h4 class="headline7">5. Project management</h4>
            <p>Many companies use an organizational structure in which different departments, teams, or team members all
                work on a singular product or project. A person who is skilled in coordinating efforts across each of
                those touchpoints is skilled in project management. These team members may be responsible for
                maintaining schedules, organizing budgets, and communicating with project stakeholders (or various
                parties interested or invested in the project outcomes).</p>
            <p>You can consider “project management” to be a catch-all term for leadership, communication, planning,
                resilience, and organizational skills</p>

            <p>Project management shows up in many careers and becomes especially important as you move into managerial
                positions. However, you can also pursue a career as a project manager. Here are some careers along the
                project manager path and their average base pay in the United States as of December 2022, according to
                Glassdoor</p><br>

            <h4 class="headline7">6. Account management</h4>
            <p>While project management typically has an internal focus, account management taps into a similar subset
                of skills to work with people outside of your organization. Often highly valued in sales positions,
                account management skills enable you to confidently position your company and its products to customers.
            </p>
            <p>Account management skills incorporate both the organizational aspects required to close a business deal
                as well as the interpersonal skills required to productively negotiate and maintain relationships. They
                often work with a customer relationship management (CRM) tool like Salesforce.</p><br>

            <h4 class="headline7">7. Content creation and management</h4>
            <p>Content creation and management skills involve storytelling and are often crucial for marketing careers.
                This skill set incorporates creativity, originality, social perceptiveness, and emotional intelligence.
                Taking these skills a step further can also mean adding data analysis to your toolbox, specifically
                honing in on marketing analytics so that you can assess how well an audience is connecting with your
                content.</p><br>

            <h4 class="headline6">Keep learning</h4>
            <p>You can build many skills through your regular work activities, however, sometimes it can help to bolster
                your skill set with outside classes or certifications. If you are trying to figure out the best skills
                for you to increase your earning potential, visit the Nexus CTC. Here, you’ll get an
                in-depth look at the key skills across several career paths and can find specific online courses for
                each path.</p>
