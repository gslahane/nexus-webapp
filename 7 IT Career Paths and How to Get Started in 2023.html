            <h4 class="headline4">7 IT Career Paths and How to Get Started in 2023</h4>
            <h5>Written by Admin | Dec 7, 2020</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg"><img src="assets/images/blog/it-career.png" /></div>
            <p>Working in IT can mean a variety of different things. You can work in computer support, cybersecurity,
                data, cloud computing, and other areas.</p>
            <p>It might be easy to assume that working in information technology (IT) means working in a tech office in
                a big city. But that’s not the whole truth. Burning Glass Technologies found that over 90 percent of IT
                skills and jobs are housed outside of the tech sector in the US. Non-tech IT jobs are also growing
                faster than tech-sector IT jobs by over 50 percent—meaning that that gap is on trend to widen [1]. Plus,
                IT skills are needed in places like hospitals, local governments, banks, and universities in smaller
                cities across the country.</p>
            <p>That said, the world of IT offers a variety of career paths in diverse industries. An IT professional can
                specialize in cybersecurity to keep computers safe, cloud computing to make information easier to
                access, or in help desk roles to assist in the everyday functions of an organization. </p> <br>
            <h4 class="headline4">IT career paths</h4>
            <p>Understanding what paths are available to you can help you navigate your first steps as you begin your
                career in IT.</p>
            <p>Not sure where to start? Many IT professionals begin in generalist roles that cover a range of issues,
                like help desk technician or IT associate. You may get an entry-level IT certification to help you land
                one of these roles, though it's often not required. Once you’ve gained some experience and have a better
                grasp of what you like doing, you might think about focusing your career on a more specific area. You
                can explore entry-level IT jobs to see what other routes you can take if you’re just starting out.</p>
            <p>Job outlook information is sourced from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and applies to the period
                2021 to 2031, unless stated otherwise.</p> <br>
            <h4 class="headline5">1. Computer support</h4>
            <p>Many in the beginning phases of their IT career work in computer support roles that support many
                different aspects of computer operations. From there, it’s possible to specialize in a narrower field
                like cybersecurity or networks, or continue in computer support to become a senior or manager.</p>
            <p><strong>Early career jobs:</strong> IT support technician, desktop support technician, help desk
                technician, IT associate</p>
            <p><strong>Mid-career or senior jobs:</strong> Senior help desk support technician, service desk supervisor,
                support desk manager</p>
            <p><strong>Getting started:</strong> If you’re just starting out, getting an entry-level IT certification
                can bring you the skills you need.</p> <br>

            <h4 class="headline5">2. Cybersecurity</h4>
            <p>Working in cybersecurity means protecting computer systems, devices, and sensitive information from
                malware, unauthorized access, damage, and data breaches. Cybersecurity is one of two fields in IT
                expected to see the most demand, according to Global Knowledge, an IT professional development company
                (the other being cloud computing).</p>
            <P><strong>Early career jobs:</strong> Information security analyst, cybersecurity analyst, cybersecurity
                engineer</P>
            <P><strong>Mid-career or senior jobs:</strong> Senior cyber engineer, information security manager, ethical
                hacker</P>
            <p><strong>Getting started:</strong> Getting a grasp of basic cybersecurity principles can help launch a
                career in this space. Consider building experience by earning an entry-level certification</p> <br>

            <h4 class="headline5">3. Networks and systems</h4>
            <P>Network IT professionals work with network-related tasks or hardware, and systems professionals work
                among servers and computer systems. They may have overlapping roles, particularly at smaller companies
                where you’re more likely to have to wear many hats. You might start as an analyst or administrator, and
                then work your way up to being a network or systems engineer or architect.</P>
            <p><strong>Early career jobs:</strong> Network administrator, systems administrator, network implementation
                technician, systems analyst</p>
            <p><strong>Mid-career or senior jobs:</strong> Network engineer, systems engineer, network security
                engineer, cloud network engineer, senior systems administrator, computer network architects</p>
            <p><strong>Getting started:</strong> Several certification options exist for networks and systems, like the
                CompTIA Server+ or the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA). Otherwise, you can start as a
                generalist on the IT help desk and work your way into one of these specialities.</p> <br>

            <h4 class="headline5">4. Software development</h4>
            <p>Software developers, or software engineers, create computer programs that are used to accomplish any
                number of tasks—your internet browser, music streaming service, and online video conference app are all
                examples of software. Software development can open paths into a variety of different industries,
                including finance, video game development, and tech.</p>
            <p><strong>Jobs:</strong> Software engineer, software developer, senior software engineer</p>
            <p><strong>Getting started:</strong> Learning the coding languages used in software development will be key
                to landing a job in the field. Try starting with commonly requested ones like Python, Java, or Ruby.</p> <br>

            <h4 class="headline5">5. Web development</h4>
            <p>Working in web development means you’ll be responsible for creating and maintaining websites and phone
                applications. Web developers can be front-end or back-end developers—that is, the front-facing
                interfaces or behind-the-scenes mechanics of a website, respectively—or both. </p>
            <p><strong>Jobs:</strong> Web developer, web designer, front-end developer, back-end developer, full stack
                developer, front-end engineer, back-end engineer, full-stack engineer</p>
            <p><strong>Getting started:</strong> Whether you’re self-taught or have a degree in computer programming,
                web development jobs often prioritize relevant experience over credentials. Taking a course in a web
                programming language—like Python, JavaScript, CSS, or HTML—can get you oriented with the basics. From
                there, you can try building your own website or application before applying to entry-level jobs.</p> <br>

            <h4 class="headline5">6. Data</h4>
            <p>With the ubiquity of internet-connected devices, companies have access to unprecedented amounts of data
                on their customers, services, and other business factors. And though data isn’t a traditional IT
                specialization, the increase in demand for data skills makes it a solid career option for those looking
                for IT-related work. Working with data can entail keeping up hardware and security as a data technician,
                or sifting through data to find patterns and insights as a data analyst or scientist.</p>
            <p><strong>Early career jobs:</strong> Data center technician, database administrator, data analyst</p>
            <p><strong>Mid-career or senior jobs:</strong> Data scientist, data engineer, data architect</p>
            <p><strong>Getting started:</strong> If you’re interested in becoming a data technician, some background
                knowledge of IT support might help. If the idea of working directly with data is more enticing to you,
                consider getting a certification in data analytics</p> <br>

            <h4 class="headline5">7. Cloud computing</h4>
            <p>Along with cybersecurity, cloud computing was found to be the top technical area in IT seeing the most
                demand by Global Knowledge . A career in cloud technology generally includes some programming on cloud
                software platforms like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud. </p>
            <p><strong>Early career jobs:</strong> Cloud engineer, cloud computing programmer</p>
            <p><strong>Mid-career or senior jobs:</strong> Cloud architect, cloud consultant</p>
            <p><strong>Getting started:</strong> If you want to break into cloud computing, you’ll likely want to have
                cloud-specific knowledge. You can earn cloud certifications</p>
